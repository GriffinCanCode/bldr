summary: "Platforms - Defining target environments"
definition: |
  Definitions of target environments (OS + CPU + other constraints).
  Used for cross-compilation and toolchain selection.

key_points:
  - "Constraint values: linux, x86_64, etc."
  - "Platform rules: Combinations of constraints"
  - "Mapping: Toolchains map to platforms"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Define platform"
    code: |
      platform(
        name = "rpi",
        constraint_values = [
          "@platforms//os:linux",
          "@platforms//cpu:arm",
        ],
      )
