summary: "Constraints - Platform compatibility"
definition: |
  Define execution constraints and platform compatibility for targets.
  Ensures targets only build on compatible platforms.

key_points:
  - "exec_properties: Requirements for execution (e.g. GPU)"
  - "target_compatible_with: Platform constraints"
  - "toolchain resolution: Matches constraints to tools"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Linux only"
    code: |
      cc_binary(
        name = "linux_tool",
        target_compatible_with = ["@platforms//os:linux"],
      )

related: [cross-compile, remote-execution, toolchains]

next_steps: |
  - Use constraints for OS-specific code
