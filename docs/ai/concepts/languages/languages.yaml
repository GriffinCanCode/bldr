summary: "Supported Languages - Multi-language build support"
definition: |
  Builder is a polyglot build system. It natively supports compilation, linking,
  and dependency management for a wide range of programming languages.

key_points:
  - "Native support: C, C++, D, Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript"
  - "Cross-compilation: Build for different architectures"
  - "Mixed builds: Seamlessly link C++ with D or Rust"
  - "Unified config: Manage all languages in one builder.yml"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Defining a C++ target"
    code: |
      targets:
        app:
          type: c++_binary
          srcs: ["main.cpp"]

  - Check 'builder explain list' for specific language guides (if available)
  - Use 'builder init' to set up language support
