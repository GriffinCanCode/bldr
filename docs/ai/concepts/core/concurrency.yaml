summary: "Concurrency - Parallel build execution"
definition: |
  Builder automatically parallelizes build steps based on the dependency graph.
  It uses a work-stealing scheduler to maximize CPU utilization.

key_points:
  - "Graph-based: Executes independent tasks in parallel"
  - "Work stealing: Efficiently balances load across cores"
  - "Resource aware: Respects CPU and memory limits"
  - "Configurable: Adjust concurrency level with flags"

usage_examples:
  - command: "bldr build"
    description: "Build with auto-detected concurrency (work-stealing)"
  - command: "export BUILDER_JOBS=8"
    description: "Manually throttle concurrency (via environment variable, if supported)"

next_steps: |
  - Trust the default auto-detection for most cases
  - Use '-j' to throttle builds on shared machines
