summary: "Build targets - the basic unit of compilation in Builder"
definition: |
  A target defines what to build (executable, library, test) and how to build it
  (sources, dependencies, flags). Targets are the basic unit of the build graph.
  
  Format: //path/to:target-name
  Example: //src/app:main, //lib:utils

target_types:
  - type: "executable"
    output: "Binary executable"
    example: "target(\"myapp\") { type: executable; }"
  
  - type: "library"
    output: "Static or shared library"
    example: "target(\"libutils\") { type: library; }"
  
  - type: "test"
    output: "Test executable"
    example: "target(\"unit_tests\") { type: test; }"
  
  - type: "custom"
    output: "Custom command"
    example: "target(\"gen\") { type: custom; command: \"./gen.sh\"; }"

target_structure:
  - field: "name"
    required: true
    description: "Unique target identifier"
  
  - field: "type"
    required: true
    description: "executable, library, test, or custom"
  
  - field: "language"
    required: "for compiled targets"
    description: "c, cpp, rust, go, python, etc."
  
  - field: "sources"
    required: true
    description: "Source files to compile"
  
  - field: "deps"
    required: false
    description: "Dependencies on other targets"
  
  - field: "flags"
    required: false
    description: "Compiler/linker flags"

example: |
  target("myapp") {
      type: executable;
      language: cpp;
      sources: ["main.cpp", "utils.cpp"];
      deps: ["//lib:utils"];
      flags: ["-O2", "-Wall"];
      output: "bin/myapp";
  }

target_addressing:
  absolute: "//path/to:target - From workspace root"
  relative: ":target - Same directory"
  package: "//path/to:all - All targets in package"
  recursive: "//path/to/... - All targets recursively"

dependencies:
  syntax: "deps: [\"//lib:utils\", \":helper\"];"
  resolution: "Builder automatically resolves and builds dependencies"
  caching: "Dependencies are cached and reused"

key_points:
  - "Basic unit of the build graph"
  - "Can depend on other targets"
  - "Cached independently"
  - "Language-agnostic definition"
  - "Supports globs in sources"
