summary: "Incremental Compilation - Speeding up rebuilds"
definition: |
  Deep dive into how Builder handles incremental compilation for languages that support it.
  This goes beyond file-level caching to artifact reuse within a single target.

key_points:
  - "State preservation: Keeps compiler state hot if possible"
  - "Partial rebuilds: Only recompiles changed functions/modules"
  - "Dependency analysis: Accurate pruning of downstream rebuilds"
