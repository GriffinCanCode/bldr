definition: |
  Conceptual explanation of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the build.
  Nodes are targets/actions, edges are dependencies.

key_points:
  - "DAG: No circular dependencies allowed"
  - "Topological sort: Determines build order"
  - "Traversal: How Builder walks the graph"

usage_examples:
  - command: "builder query --graph"
