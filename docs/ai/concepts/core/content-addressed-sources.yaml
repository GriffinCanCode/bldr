summary: "Content Addressed Sources - Source file management"
definition: |
  Builder tracks source files by their content (hash) rather than just path/timestamp.
  This enables accurate change detection and caching regardless of file location or time.

key_points:
  - "Hash-based: Changes detected via BLAKE3 hash"
  - "Location independence: Renaming file doesn't change hash"
  - "Efficiency: Fast comparison of source trees"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Core mechanism, always active"

next_steps: |
  - Understand that 'touching' a file without changing content won't trigger a rebuild
