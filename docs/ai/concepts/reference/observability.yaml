summary: "Observability - Tracing and debugging builds"
definition: |
  Observability features provide deep visibility into what the build system is doing.
  It supports distributed tracing, structured logging, and performance profiling.

key_points:
  - "Trace export: Export spans to Jaeger/OpenTelemetry"
  - "Critical path: Identify the bottleneck in your build"
  - "Structured logs: JSON logs for analysis"
  - "Resource usage: CPU/RAM usage over time"

usage_examples:
  - command: "builder build --trace=trace.json"
    description: "Generate a build trace file"

related: [telemetry, performance, concurrency]

next_steps: |
  - Load trace.json into Chrome Tracing (chrome://tracing) or Perfetto
  - Analyze critical path to optimize build times
