summary: "Distributed Builds - Scale builds across a cluster"
definition: |
  Distributed builds allow you to offload build actions to a cluster of machines,
  significantly speeding up large builds by utilizing shared compute resources.

key_points:
  - "Remote execution: Run compilers/tests on remote workers"
  - "Scalability: Scale from one to hundreds of cores"
  - "Transparency: Works without code changes"
  - "Protocol: Uses standard Remote Execution API (REAPI)"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Configure remote execution"
    code: |
      remote:
        address: "grpc://build-farm.example.com:8980"

related: [remote-cache, hermetic, action-cache]

next_steps: |
  - Set up a REAPI-compatible build farm
  - Configure remote endpoint in builder.yml
