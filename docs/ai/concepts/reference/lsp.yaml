  Builder includes a built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation to provide
  IDE features like autocompletion, diagnostics, and go-to-definition for Builder files
  (.builder, .bldr).

key_points:
  - "Standard LSP: Works with VSCode, Neovim, Emacs, etc."
  - "Autocompletion: Suggests targets, dependencies, and config options"
  - "Diagnostics: Real-time error checking and linting"
  - "Go-to-definition: Jump to target definitions"

        "builder.lsp.enabled": true,
        "builder.lsp.path": "/usr/local/bin/builder"
      }

related: [cli, workspace, targets]
