summary: "Build Verification - Ensure build correctness and reproducibility"
definition: |
  Verification tools helps ensure your builds are correct, complete, and reproducible.
  It checks for missing dependencies, non-hermetic inputs, and undeclared outputs.

key_points:
  - "Sandboxing checks: Detect file access outside declared inputs"
  - "Reproducibility check: Verify bit-for-bit identical builds"
  - "Header verification: Ensure all included headers are declared"

usage_examples:
  - command: "bldr verify"
    description: "Run standard verification checks"

related: [determinism, hermetic, security]

next_steps: |
  - Run verification in CI pipelines
  - Fix any reported hermeticity violations
