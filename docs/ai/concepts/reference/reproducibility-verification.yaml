summary: "Reproducibility Verification - Validating build determinism"
definition: |
  Tools to verify that builds are truly reproducible. Can run builds twice
  and compare outputs to detect non-deterministic behavior.

key_points:
  - "Double build: Build twice, compare checksums"
  - "Environment variation: Can inject random variations to test robustness"
  - "Audit report: detailed diff of non-matching artifacts"

usage_examples:
  - command: "builder verify --reproducible"
