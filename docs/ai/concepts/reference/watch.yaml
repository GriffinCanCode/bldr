summary: "Watch Mode - Intelligent auto-rebuild on file changes"
definition: |
  Watch mode monitors your source files and automatically triggers rebuilds or test runs
  when changes are detected. It uses efficient file system events rather than polling.

key_points:
  - "Event-driven: Low CPU usage, immediate response"
  - "Smart debouncing: Groups rapid changes into single builds"
  - "Incremental: Only rebuilds what changed"
  - "Resilient: Continues watching even after build errors"

usage_examples:
  - command: "builder watch"
    description: "Watch and rebuild on change"
  
  - command: "builder watch --test"
    description: "Watch and run tests on change"

next_steps: |
  - Use 'builder watch' during active development
  - Combine with 'builder test' for TDD workflows
