summary: "Plugin System - Extend Builder with custom logic"
definition: |
  Builder's plugin system allows you to extend functionality using Python scripts.
  Plugins can define new build steps, custom validation, or integration with external tools.

key_points:
  - "Python API: Write plugins in standard Python"
  - "Hooks: Intercept build events (pre-build, post-build)"
  - "Custom Rules: Define new target types"
  - "Sandboxed: Plugins run in a controlled environment"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Plugin definition structure"
    code: |
      def build(ctx):
          ctx.action(
              inputs=["src/main.custom"],
              outputs=["bin/app"],
              cmd="custom-compiler $1 -o $2"
          )
