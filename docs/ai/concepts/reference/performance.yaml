summary: "Performance Tuning - Making builds faster"
definition: |
  General guide to optimizing build performance with Builder.
  Covers caching, parallelism, hardware usage, and configuration.

key_points:
  - "Cache hit rate: Maximize with hermetic builds"
  - "Network: Optimize remote cache bandwidth"
  - "IO: Use fast SSDs for workspace"
  - "CPU: More cores = faster clean builds"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Analyze build profile"
    command: "builder profile"

next_steps: |
  - Profile before optimizing
  - Ensure caching is working effective
