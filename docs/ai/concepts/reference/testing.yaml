summary: "Testing System - Unified test runner for all languages"
definition: |
  Builder provides a unified testing interface that works across all supported languages.
  It can run unit tests, integration tests, and benchmark tests with consistent reporting.

key_points:
  - "Unified runner: One command for C++, D, Python, etc."
  - "Parallel execution: Runs independent tests concurrently"
  - "Caching: Skips tests if code hasn't changed"
  - "Rich reporting: Detailed pass/fail output and timing"

usage_examples:
  - command: "builder test"
    description: "Run all tests in the workspace"
  
  - command: "builder test //core:..."
    description: "Run tests for specific targets"

next_steps: |
  - Define test targets in your builder.yml
  - Run 'builder test' to verify your code
