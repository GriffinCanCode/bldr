summary: "BldrQuery - Query language for the build graph"
definition: |
  BldrQuery allows you to inspect and query the dependency graph. You can find
  reverse dependencies, paths between targets, and filter targets by attributes.

key_points:
  - "Graph inspection: Understand complex dependencies"
  - "Filtering: Select targets based on tags or types"
  - "Path finding: Debug why a target is included"
  - "Scriptable: Output in JSON/text for tools"

usage_examples:
  - command: "builder query 'deps(//main)'"
    description: "List all dependencies of //main"
  
  - command: "builder query 'rdeps(//common/lib)'"
    description: "List all targets depending on //common/lib"

related: [cli, targets, dependencies]

next_steps: |
  - Use query to debug circular dependencies
  - Use query to find impact of changing a library
