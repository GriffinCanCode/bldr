summary: "Command Line Interface - The primary way to interact with Builder"
definition: |
  The Builder CLI provides a unified interface for all build, test, and management operations.
  It follows a consistent `bldr <command> [subcommand] [flags]` structure.

key_points:
  - "Unified entry point: One tool for all languages"
  - "Consistent syntax: Standardized flags across commands"
  - "Rich output: Color-coded, structured output"
  - "Intelligent defaults: Zero-config for most common tasks"

usage_examples:
  - command: "bldr build"
    description: "Build the current project"
  
  - command: "bldr test"
    description: "Run all tests"

  - command: "bldr explain list"
    description: "List all documentation topics"
