summary: "Docker Integration - Building containers (Planned)"
definition: |
  Building Docker/OCI images deterministically without a Docker daemon.
  Images are just tarballs of layers.
  
  NOTE: This feature is currently in planning.

key_points:
  - "Deterministic: Same inputs = same image hash"
  - "Fast: Layer caching"
  - "No daemon: Runs purely in user space"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Image rule"
    code: |
      container_image(
        name = "image",
        base = "@distroless//image",
        entrypoint = ["/app"],
        files = [":app"],
      )
