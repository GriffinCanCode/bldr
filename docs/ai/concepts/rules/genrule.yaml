summary: "Genrule - Generic build rule (Planned)"
definition: |
  A flexible rule to run arbitrary shell commands to generate outputs.
  Useful when no specific rule exists for a task.
  
  NOTE: This feature is currently in planning.

key_points:
  - "Bash: Runs in bash shell"
  - "Inputs/Outputs: Must be explicitly declared"
  - "Tools: Can depend on other executable targets"

usage_examples:
  - description: "Generate a header"
    code: |
      genrule(
        name = "version_h",
        outs = ["version.h"],
        cmd = "echo '#define VERSION 1' > $@",
      )

next_steps: |
  - Use specialized rules over genrule when possible
